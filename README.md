"An e-commerce adventure Planning app"

Whilst my Android internship with Broadway Infosys, I proceeded to work on a small side project apart from the project I was developing at the firm. “The Junkie”, is an E-commerce platform app which allows the customers to view and book varoius adventure and thrill related activitues. It allows for booking and management of the products offered via the app. I made an extensive use of fragments to generate the homepage which is supported by a navigation drawer to glide through the different activities. I have also integrated various third party libraries into the app for a better aesthetic appeal. It is still a work under progress and I do plan to develop it further and add functionality along the way. I developed the app using Android Studio via JAVA and for the database I used DB browser for SQLite to manage the database. Please proceed to look at the screenchot folder to view the snapshot of the project.

Thanks and Regards,
Samyak Manandhar.
