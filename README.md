# The Adventure Junkie
"An e-commerce adventure Planning app"
"This app is made for educational purpose only and for my private learning."

Whilst my Android internship with Broadway Infosys and my University project thesis, I proceeded to work on a small side project apart from the project I was developing at the firm. “The Junkie”, is an E-commerce platform app that allows customers to view and book various adventure and thrill related activities. It allows for booking and management of the products offered via the app. I made extensive use of fragments to generate the homepage which is supported by a navigation drawer to glide through the different activities. I have also integrated various third-party libraries into the app for a better aesthetic appeal. I have extensively researched and enabled MediaStore class and Jetpack libraries to capture images and upload images from the local device. Google Login API was incorporated for quicker access to the authenticated side after updating all the appropriate Gradle files. I utilized ListView ArrayAdapter with a container class to dynamically generate events, dates, and times. Finally, I used Firebase SDKs to conduct performance metrics and automated testing. I developed the app using Android Studio via Java and for the database, and I used the DB Browser for SQLite to manage the database. Please refer to the youtube video where I present a walkthrough of the app, https://youtu.be/senVhytsAdU .

Thanks and Regards,
